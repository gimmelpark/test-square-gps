You can use the full build supplied by\n * Proj4js, or create a custom build to support those projections you need; see\n * the Proj4js website for how to do this. You also need the Proj4js definitions\n * for the required projections. These definitions can be obtained from\n * https://epsg.io/, and are a JS function, so can be loaded in a script\n * tag (as in the examples) or pasted into your application.\n *\n * After all required projection definitions are added to proj4's registry (by\n * using `proj4.defs()`), simply call `register(proj4)` from the `ol/proj/proj4`\n * package. Existing transforms are not changed by this function. See\n * examples/wms-image-custom-proj for an example of this.\n *\n * Additional projection definitions can be registered with `proj4.defs()` any\n * time. Just make sure to call `register(proj4)` again; for example, with user-supplied data where you don't\n * know in advance what projections are needed, you can initially load minimal\n * support and then load whichever are requested.\n *\n * Note that Proj4js does not support projection extents. If you want to add\n * one for creating default tile grids, you can add it after the Projection\n * object has been created with `setExtent`, for example,\n * `get('EPSG:1234').setExtent(extent)`.\n *\n * In addition to Proj4js support, any transform functions can be added with\n * {@link module:ol/proj.addCoordinateTransforms}. To use this, you must first create\n * a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection~Projection} object for the new projection and add it with\n * {@link module:ol/proj.addProjection}. You can then add the forward and inverse\n * functions with {@link module:ol/proj.addCoordinateTransforms}.

The layer will not be\n * rendered outside of this extent.\n * @property {number} [zIndex] The z-index for layer rendering.  At rendering time, the layers\n * will be ordered, first by Z-index and then by position.

Function to be used when sorting\n * features before rendering. By default features are drawn in the order that they are created.

The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Web Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The view states\n *\n * A View is determined by three states: `center`, `resolution`,\n * and `rotation`. Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * The `zoom` state is actually not saved on the view: all computations\n * internally use the `resolution` state. Still, the `setZoom` and `getZoom`\n * methods are available, as well as `getResolutionForZoom` and\n * `getZoomForResolution` to switch from one system to the other.\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view, but any constraint defined in the constructor will\n * be applied along the way.\n *\n * A View object can have a *resolution constraint*, a *rotation constraint*\n * and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* typically restricts min/max values and\n * snaps to specific resolutions. It is determined by the following\n * options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`, `maxZoom` and `zoomFactor`.\n * If `resolutions` is set, the other three options are ignored. See\n * documentation for each option for more information. By default, the view\n * only has a min/max restriction and allow intermediary zoom levels when\n * pinch-zooming for example.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default rotation is allowed and its value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the view center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * ### Changing the view state\n *\n * It is important to note that `setZoom`, `setResolution`, `setCenter` and\n * `setRotation` are subject to the above mentioned constraints. As such, it\n * may sometimes not be possible to know in advance the resulting state of the\n * View. For example, calling `setResolution(10)` does not guarantee that\n * `getResolution()` will return `10`.\n *\n * A consequence of this is that, when applying a delta on the view state, one\n * should use `adjustCenter`, `adjustRotation`, `adjustZoom` and `adjustResolution`\n * rather than the corresponding setters. This will let view do its internal\n * computations. Besides, the `adjust*` methods also take an `anchor`\n * argument which allows specifying an origin for the transformation.\n *\n * ### Interacting with the view\n *\n * View constraints are usually only applied when the view is *at rest*, meaning that\n * no interaction or animation is ongoing.

The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method. E.g.\n * object.unset('foo').\n *\n * @fires ObjectEvent\n * @api\n */\nclass BaseObject extends Observable {\n  /**\n   * @param {Object<string, *>} [values] An object with key-value pairs.\n   */\n  constructor(values) {\n    super();\n\n    /***\n     * @type {ObjectOnSignature<import(\"./events\").EventsKey>}\n     */\n    this.on;\n\n    /***\n     * @type {ObjectOnSignature<import(\"./events\").EventsKey>}\n     */\n    this.once;\n\n    /***\n     * @type {ObjectOnSignature<void>}\n     */\n    this.un;\n\n    // Call {@link module:ol/util.getUid} to ensure that the order of objects' ids is\n    // the same as the order in which they were created.
